N kids stand in a line, each having an integer rating. We distribute candies where:
    Each kid gets at least 1 candy
    Kids with higher ratings than their neighbors get more candies.
Find the minimum candies required.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1e5

Example:
Input: [1,3,7,1]
Output: 7

Explanation:
Candies: [1,2,3,1]
