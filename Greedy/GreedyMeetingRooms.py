"""
Given a list of intervals: [start, end] for meetings. Find the least number of meeting rooms required.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1e5
1<= A[i][0] <= A[i][1] <= 1e9

Example:
Input: [[5,10], [15,20], [0,30]]
Output: 2

Explanation:
[0,30] and [5,10] take place simultaneously. Same for [0,30] and [15,20]
"""
# Thought: We only care about the places where the change happens.
# From the example above we can deduce that at time (5, 15, 0) we increase the current meeting room requirement by 1 (+1)
# And when we hit time (10, 20, 30) we decrease the room requirement by 1 (-1)
# Therefore, we create tuples to solve this problem such as (0, +1), (5, +1), (10, -1)...
