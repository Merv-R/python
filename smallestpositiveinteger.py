Write a function:
    def solution(A)
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
[1,3,6,4,1,2]
[1,2,3]
